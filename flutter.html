                        <p>Just as with React Native, one of the first apps I worked on in Flutter was a chat
                            application. This time, I also decided to address some of the issues I had encountered with
                            the React Native version of the app.<br><br>I used firebase for authentication and a
                            realtime database, which improved the security aspect as well as the fact that the users
                            could now receive messages without triggering events on their device (such as hitting
                            refresh).<br><br>Other than the basic functionality wherein users could message each other,
                            I also added a feature to create and chat in groups. The app also showed the date above a
                            group of messages sent on one day, and the time with each message. The data/time display is
                            also designed such that the sender and receiver can be in different time zones, and the
                            date/time would be shown according to the time-zone that the user is in.</p>

            <h2>&lt;Photo Journal&gt;</h2>
            <h6><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shreyasnisal/Photo-Journal">GitHub</a></h6>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="notepad-container">
                    <div class="textcontainer">
                        <p>The Photo Journal app was something I worked on as a weekend project. The app lets users
                            upload their most treasured photos with a caption, and the home screen shows these photos in
                            an instagram-like interface. The user can also set a date/time with the photo, and can
                            delete existing posts. Photos posted in the app are only visible to them, since the photo
                            journal was never meant to be a photo "sharing" application.<br><br>I used firebase for
                            authentication, database, and photo storage, and a few flutter packages to allow users to
                            pick images from the device storage. It was a fun exercise to develop a simple but complete
                            app with an appealing user interface in such a short time, with a couple of iterations of
                            major design changes to the database schema.</p>
