                        <p>JPad is my very own text-editor, which supports creating new files, saving, opening and
                            modifying files. It also supports changing the font, the font size, and allows styling
                            (bold/italics/underline) to parts of the text. The text editor also has undo/redo
                            operations, which I implemented using the UndoManager class from the JFC.<br><br>I also had
                            to add keyboard shortcuts for operations, which I did, and JPad was ready! I could open
                            multiple windows and start typing. Although not the best text-editor, it is something of my
                            own, and I was pretty happy with it.</p>

                        <p>Remember atari breakout? If not, try doing a Google serach and going into images (from a
                            desktop machine)! I decided to make a brick breaker game, with treading and the graphics
                            toolkits. Since I was also creating videos on Object Oriented Programming with Java during
                            this time, I decided to cover graphics in the videos via this game. Although the entire game
                            is not covered in the videos, they give an appreciable start towards it.<br><br>My final
                            game didn't have the most perfect collisions, and I did not add any effect on the ball based
                            on where it hit the paddle, so the user had very little control on the game, but I was able
                            to make a decent brick-breaker within a short span of time.</p>

                        <p>Having done the brick breaker in Java, I gave myself a challenge- I had to create a snake
                            game without taking help online, except for the oracle Java docs. I was able to get down a
                            basic version in a couple of hours, although there were still tweaks I meant to
                            make.<br><br>I later added a feature that food cannot spawn on the snake body/head, and also
                            went on to add a menu screen and a highscore screen. Although the highscore is stored in a
                            text file as plaintext, meaning that anyone can open the file and enter a desired score, I
                            wasn't too worried about the security aspect here. I later enjoyed testing out the game by
                            competing with my friend turn-by-turn to beat each others' highscores!</p>
