                        <p>As part of my Object Oriented Programming course, I got introduced to the Swing GUI framework and the Abstract Window Toolkit. I decided to use these graphics frameworks to develop some retro games in Java, and also a simple text-editor of my own.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Remember atari breakout? If not, try doing a Google serach and going into images (from a desktop machine)! I decided to make a brick breaker game, with treading and the graphics toolkits. Since I was also creating videos on Object Oriented Programming with Java during this time, I decided to cover graphics in the videos via this game. Although the entire game is not covered in the videos, they give an appreciable start towards it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My final game didn't have the most perfect collisions, and I did not add any effect on the ball badsed on where it hit the paddle, so the user had very little control on the game, but I was able to make a decent brick-breaker within a short span of time. The java code for the same is available on <a href="https://github.com/shreyasnisal/BrickBreaker" target="_blank"><u>GitHub</u></a></p>

                            <h1>Snake</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>Having done the brick breaker in Java, I gave myself a challenge- I had to create a snake game without taking help online, except for the oracle Java docs. I was able to get down a basic version in a couple of hours, although there were still tweaks I meant to make.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I later added a feature that food cannot spawn on the snake body/head, and also went on to add a menu screen and a highscore screen. Although the higscore is stored in a text file as plaintext, meaning that anyone can open the file and enter a desired score, I wasn't too worried about the security aspect here. I later enjoyed testing out the game by competing with my friend turn-by-turn to beat each others' higscores! If you want to take a look, the code is all <a href="https://github.com/shreyasnisal/Snake-Game" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If I were to do this project again, I would probably incorporate better design practices, which I completely neglected the first time. I ended up writing most of my code in a small number of files, and not in the most object oriented manner as possbile.</p>

                            <h1>JPad</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>JPad is my very own text-editor, which supports creating new files, saving, opening and modifying files. It also supports changing the font, the font size, and allows styling (bold/italics/underline) to parts of the text. The text editor also has undo/redo operations, which I implemented using the UndoManager class from the JFC.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I also had to add keyboard shortcuts for operations, which I did, and JPad was ready! I could open multiple windows and start typing. Although not the best text-editor, it is something of my own, and I was pretty happy with it.
