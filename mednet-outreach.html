                        <p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, it became difficult for doctors to consult and diagnose their patients even for common diseases such as influenza, or to take a look at follow-up patients who had been operated upon before the lockdown started.<br><br>During this time, Oakland Systems, which works on software solutions for hospitals, decided to build a number of apps to enable doctors to consult patients via video calling.</p>

                        <p>With a work-from-home team of around 8 developers, we developed 1 web app and 2 mobile apps. Patients could use a mobile app and request an appointment with an available doctor. Patients can also pay for the consultation via the app. The doctor could read the details provided with the request, initiate a video call with the patient, and send a prescription via the app. The apps use the Twilio video calling API.<br><br>I worked on the doctor-app, developed in react native by a two-member team. I was also responsible for the video call integration into the web version of the doctor-app. The project duration was around two weeks, from 25th March to 10th April 2020.</p>
