                        <p>Orginally developed as a normal quiz applications with a database of 90 questions with a back
                            end of Java and MySQL, I made a lot of changes to make it interesting. I moved the database
                            to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file within the app itself, to eliminate dependency
                            on a back end.<br><br>Later, I decided to play around with the speech recognition and
                            synthesis libraries in React Native, and made the app completely voice controlled. Apart
                            from the phonetic analysis done by these libraries itself, there is no conventional NLP
                            algorithm being used, and yet the conversation is smooth and natural.<br><br>Other than
                            answering questions using voice, the user can also ask the app to repeat questions, read out
                            options, or skip questions, among a lot of other options. The app also detects negatives in
                            a statement to correctly recognize what the user does NOT want done. All of this done by
                            simply iterating through the text generated from speech and detecting certain words!</p>

                        <p>The Chat-App app allows users to sign up and send/recieve messages from other users
                            registered in the app. The app uses a back end written in Java, with a MySQL database to
                            store login information and messages.<br><br>The app has multiple issues as far as usability
                            is concerned. In the absence of encryption protocols, passwords in the MySQL database are
                            stored as plain text and transmitted over the network in the same way. The app also does not
                            use websockets, and users do not receive messages in real-time. Rather, they must hit
                            refresh to receive new messages.<br><br>As one of my first applications, I was happy with
                            this limited functionality, and my takeaway was a better understanding of React Native,
                            redux, and network concepts.</p>
