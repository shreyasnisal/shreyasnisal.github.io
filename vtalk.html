                        <p>VTalk is an app that facilitates communication between Deaf-Mute people and speaking-hearing people. The app uses speech recognition and synthesis to enable a Deaf person to have a smooth dialogue with a speaking-hearing person.<br><br>The Deaf person can hold the phone in his hand, and when the speaking-hearing person says something, it appears as a text message on app. To respond, the Deaf person can type in a message, which is read to the speaking-hearing person by the device.<br><br>VTalk is a solo project right from the idea, code, testing and marketing.</p>

                        <p>The app was tested out in schools for the Deaf-Mute, and also in an employment fair (employAbility) organized by Ability Foundation, Chennai, and received an incredible response from the users.<br><br>The app also has several additional features, including saving conversations (on the device using SQLite), support for multiple languages, and an interview-sepcific screen, from where chats are stored on Firebase to allow organizations such as Ability Foundation to also view interview conversations and monitor the performance of the app.<br><br>I also presented the app at AOICON (National Conference of Association of Otolaryngologists of India) in January 2020.</p>
